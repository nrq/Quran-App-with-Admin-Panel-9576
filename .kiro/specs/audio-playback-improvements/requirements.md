# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical user experience issues with the Quran audio playback functionality. Currently, users experience disruptive page scrolling when playing or pausing audio, cannot pause ayat playback, and lose their reading position when closing the application. These improvements will create a seamless, uninterrupted audio experience with persistent state management.
