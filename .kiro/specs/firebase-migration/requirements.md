# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the Quran App from Supabase to Firebase for data persistence and admin settings management. The migration includes authentication, database operations, and custom audio URL management while maintaining compatibility with Vercel hosting.

## Glossary

- **Firebase_Client**: The Firebase SDK client instance used for database and authentication operations
- **Firestore_Database**: Firebase's NoSQL document database for storing application data
- **Firebase_Auth**: Firebase Authentication service for admin user management
- **Vercel_Environment**: Environment variables configuration in Vercel hosting platform
- **Admin_Panel**: The administrative interface for managing custom audio URLs and tafseer entries
- **Audio_Mapping**: Database records linking Quran verses to custom audio URLs
- **Tafseer_Entry**: Database records containing verse interpretations and explanations
- **Custom_URL**: User-defined audio URLs for specific Quran verses

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to replace Supabase with Firebase for data persistence, so that I can use Firebase's ecosystem and features for the Quran app.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes, THE Firebase_Client SHALL establish connection using environment variables
2. THE Firebase_Client SHALL replace all Supabase client instances throughout the codebase
3. THE Firestore_Database SHALL store the same data structure as the current Supabase tables
4. WHERE Firebase credentials are needed, THE system SHALL use Vercel environment variables for secure storage
5. THE migration SHALL maintain all existing functionality without data loss

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want Firebase Authentication to handle my login credentials, so that I can securely access the admin panel.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin attempts to login, THE Firebase_Auth SHALL validate credentials against stored admin users
2. THE Firebase_Auth SHALL maintain session persistence across browser refreshes
3. WHEN login is successful, THE Firebase_Auth SHALL provide user session data
4. WHEN logout is requested, THE Firebase_Auth SHALL clear the authentication session
5. THE authentication flow SHALL maintain the same user experience as the current Supabase implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to manage custom audio URLs through Firebase, so that I can continue adding and editing audio mappings for Quran verses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN custom URLs are created, THE Firestore_Database SHALL store them in a custom_urls collection
2. WHEN audio mappings are saved, THE Firestore_Database SHALL store them in an audio_mappings collection
3. WHEN tafseer entries are added, THE Firestore_Database SHALL store them in a tafseer_entries collection
4. THE Firestore_Database SHALL support upsert operations for updating existing records
5. THE Firestore_Database SHALL maintain referential relationships between audio mappings and custom URLs

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer deploying to Vercel, I want Firebase credentials stored as environment variables, so that sensitive configuration is secure and easily manageable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE system SHALL read Firebase configuration from Vercel environment variables
2. THE Firebase_Client SHALL initialize using environment variables for API keys and project settings
3. WHERE environment variables are missing, THE system SHALL provide clear error messages
4. THE environment configuration SHALL support both development and production environments
5. THE credential storage SHALL follow security best practices for API key management

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user of the Quran app, I want all existing functionality to work seamlessly after the Firebase migration, so that my experience remains unchanged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads, THE Firestore_Database SHALL provide the same data as before migration
2. THE offline functionality SHALL continue to work with cached data
3. THE audio playback features SHALL function with migrated audio mappings
4. THE tafseer display SHALL work with migrated tafseer entries
5. THE application performance SHALL be maintained or improved after migration
