# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for preparing the Quran application for submission to the Google Play Store (Android) and Apple App Store (iOS). The application is currently a React-based web application built with Vite that needs to be packaged as native mobile applications using Capacitor. The preparation includes configuring native mobile projects, implementing platform-specific features, creating required assets, and ensuring compliance with both app store guidelines.

## Glossary

- **Capacitor**: A cross-platform native runtime that allows web applications to run as native mobile apps on iOS and Android
- **Mobile App**: The native application package that will be submitted to app stores
- **Play Store**: Google's official app store for Android applications
- **App Store**: Apple's official app store for iOS applications
- **Native Project**: The platform-specific project files (Android Studio for Android, Xcode for iOS) generated by Capacitor
- **App Icon**: The launcher icon displayed on device home screens and in app stores
- **Splash Screen**: The initial screen displayed while the app is loading
- **Bundle ID**: A unique identifier for the iOS application (e.g., com.company.quranapp)
- **Package Name**: A unique identifier for the Android application (e.g., com.company.quranapp)
- **Signing Certificate**: Digital certificate used to sign the app for distribution
- **App Store Connect**: Apple's platform for managing iOS app submissions
- **Google Play Console**: Google's platform for managing Android app submissions
- **PWA**: Progressive Web App - web application with native-like capabilities
- **Service Worker**: Background script that enables offline functionality and caching
