# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The search bar component is not appearing at all in the navigation header between "NurulQuran" and "Last Ayah Read". Users cannot access the search functionality because the search bar is completely hidden or not rendering properly. A solution is needed to make search accessible through an expandable search interface.
